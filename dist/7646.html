    <p><strong>Congratulations!</strong> You finished the challenge.</p>
    <p>You faced seedy CSS wizards, firebreathing dragons and hell-raising hackers.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, you lost.</p>
    <p>Yeah sorry about that. Better luck next time.</p>
    <br/>
    <p>This game is made with just HTML. No JavaScript, no CSS and no backend.</p>
    <p>I should of put more effort into this, but tbh, this was a pain in the ass to make.</p>
    <p>Maybe next time.</p>
    <br/>
    <p>Share if you care.</p>
